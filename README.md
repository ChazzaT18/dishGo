## DishGo (Work in Progress)

DishGo is a mobile application built using React Native, leveraging the power of Supabase and Google APIs, and deployed with Expo Go. The core functionality of DishGo is to assist users in finding specific dishes they crave within a chosen area, providing restaurant recommendations that offer those dishes nearby.

### Key Features:
- **Search by Dish**: Users can search for a particular dish they are craving.
- **Location-based Results**: Results are tailored based on the user's specified area.
- **Set Search Radius**: Users can adjust the search radius to find dishes within a specific distance.
- **User Accounts**: Users can create accounts to save their favorite dishes and preferences.
- **Business Page**: Restaurants can create business accounts to add their own dishes to the database, enhancing the variety of available options.
- **Map View**: View dishes on a map for a visual representation of nearby options.
- **Open in Google Maps**: Users can easily navigate to a restaurant's location using Google Maps integration.
- **Restaurant Page**: Directly connected to Google Places API, providing comprehensive information about the restaurant.

### Local Setup:
Due to the integration of API keys for Google and Supabase, the project cannot be run locally without these keys. If you're interested in exploring the application further or are considering me for a position, please feel free to contact me via the phone number provided on my CV. I'll be happy to provide access to the necessary keys for local testing.
